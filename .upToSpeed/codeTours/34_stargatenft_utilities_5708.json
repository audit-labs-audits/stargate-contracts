It allows error messages to be updated on-chain without redeploying the contract.\n\n\nCorrect: B). It reduces deployment and runtime gas costs while enabling parameterized error reporting.\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is that custom errors are more gas-efficient than `require()` strings for both deployment and runtime execution. They also allow passing parameters (e.g., `TokenDoesNotExist(tokenId)`), which provides more context for debugging off-chain. While separating errors does improve readability, the gas and data benefits are the primary engineering driver for this pattern. Error messages are part of the contract's bytecode and cannot be changed post-deployment.",
