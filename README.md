Audit done by **Hacken** and is available in the root of the repo (`Hacken_Vechain Foundation_[SCA] VeChain _ Stargate _ May 2025 _P-2025-1669_3_20250630 10_14.pdf`).

## Stargate

Stargate is VeChain‚Äôs new staking platform, designed to transform how users participate in the VeChainThor network. Users can stake VET tokens, and use those to delegate them to a validator node of the protocol.
Their staking position is represented by an NFT.

This repo contains the StargateNFT, StargateDelegation and NodeManagementV3 contracts, plus a set of utility and mock contracts.

## Requirements

Ensure your development environment is set up with the following:

- **Node.js (v20 or later):** [Download here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) üì•
- **Yarn:** [Install here](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable) üß∂
- **Docker (for containerization):** [Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) üê≥
- **Hardhat (for smart contracts):** [Getting Started with Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/getting-started) ‚õëÔ∏è

### Getting Started

Clone the repository, then install dependencies:

```bash
nvm use # Align your node version
```

```bash
yarn # Run this at the root level of the project
```

Place your `.env` file in the root folder. Copy `.env.example` and rename it to `.env`, then change values to your own. When running on Solo (see next section) you can re-use the values from the example file.

## Running on Solo Network Locally (docker needed!) üîß

### Spin up the Solo Network in a docker container

```bash
  yarn solo-up
```

### Spin down the Solo Network

```bash
  yarn solo-down
```

### Deploy contracts

You can deploy the contracts without starting the frontend by running the following command:

```bash
  yarn contracts:deploy:solo
```

This command will redeploy the contracts BUT WILL NOT save the addresses in the `packages/config/local.ts` file. You need to do that manually.

To change the network you can do as follows:

```bash
  yarn contracts:deploy:testnet
```

Notice: After deploying the contracts you will need to manually deposit VTHO inside the StargateDelegation contract, otherwise you will not be able to claim delegation rewards or re-delegate.

### Run tests

Note that tests will run on the Hardhat network.

```bash
  yarn contracts:test
```

### Run tests with coverage

```bash
  yarn contracts:test:coverage
```

Open the coverage report in the `packages/contracts/coverage/index.html` file in your browser to see the test coverage.

### Generate documentation

```bash
  yarn contracts:generate-docs
```

## Project Structure

This project is using [Turborepo](https://turborepo.com/) to manage multiple projects under the same repository (frontend, contracts, packages).

The main project is the `apps/frontend` folder. Everytime we start the frontend it will also compile the contracts (under the `packages/contracts` folder) and deploy them if they are not deployed yet. This will allow to have up to date ABIs, addresses and types in the frontend.

### Frontend (apps/frontend) üåê

A blazing-fast React application powered by Vite with Chakra UI, Framer Motion, and VeChain-Kit.

### Contracts (packages/contracts) üìú

Smart contracts in Solidity, managed with Hardhat for deployment on the Vechain Thor network.

### Packages üì¶

Shared configurations and utility functions to unify and simplify the development process.
